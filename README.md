                    ##Website Presentation for Harriet Boone

Attached is a website presentation proposal for Harriet Boone in preparation for her Business startup analysis.

The website interface follows standard conventions. I initiated the design process by crafting two flexbox containers and creating sample blog posts with a "read more" feature to direct users to the main content. This ensures that upon logging in, users are greeted with the latest blog or vlog entries. Each blog element is encapsulated within its own flexbox container, with content alignment centralized for enhanced visual coherence.

Within a secondary flexbox container, I arranged two articles, employing a centered layout to prioritize the most recent article at the forefront, creating a visually engaging triangular pattern.

Subsequently, I developed a navigation bar featuring hyperlinks for seamless navigation throughout the website. Although the respective sections are yet to be populated, temporary links have been incorporated for demonstrative purposes, pending client approval.

Additionally, I included a section highlighting best-selling items. Leveraging JavaScript, I programmed the button to dynamically alter the displayed product image and price upon selecting one of the top five best-selling items.

The foundational layout is completed with a footer, housing links to Harriet Boone's social media profiles, a provisional logo, and a copyright notice accompanied by a disclaimer.

Furthermore, various stylistic enhancements have been applied to the CSS file to augment the website's aesthetic appeal. It's worth noting that these design elements are entirely customizable, allowing for future discussions regarding color palettes and element placement to align with the client's preferences.

Following revisions, I introduced a "change theme" functionality and integrated support for dyslexia-friendly text to enhance accessibility, underscoring our commitment to inclusive design principles.
