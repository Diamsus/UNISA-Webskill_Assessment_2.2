Attached is a website presentation proposal for Harriet Boone in preparation for her Business startup analysis.

The website display is fairly standard, I have begun by created two flex box containers and mocked up some example blog with a read more function to link to the main post. This is so when users log into the website they are greeted with the most recent blog(or vlog) posts I put one blog element in its own flexbox container and justfied the content center.

In a second flexbox container I put two articles and also centered this way we have the most recent article on top in a trianglular pattern.

I moved on to creating a Nav bar with hyperlinks to other areas of the website for easy access whilst these are not yet created I have put a temporary link for functionality presentation purposes until such a time as the client accepts the proposal.

I thought it would also be prudent to add a best selling link area, using JS I have coded the button to change the picture and price when one of the best selling 5 items are selected.

Finalliy in the basic layout is a footer with links to her social media, a temporay logo and a copyright notice and disclaimer.

To complete I have added various elements to the CSS file in order to improve attractiveness, it is important to note that this is entirely customisable and if the client wishes to we can discuss colour palletes and placement at a later date.
